# Divide and Conquer

Problems that have _Optimal Substructure_ (problems where solution to the original problem can be constructed from the solutions of its sub-problems) can be solved using Divide and Conquer.
Problems that are solved with Divide and Conquer *do not* have _Overlapping Sub-problems_, which we will discuss later in Dynamic Programming chapter.

Sort / Binary Search are great examples of Divide and Conquer.

# Sort

There are several sorting algorithms with quadratic runtime (_Bubble Sort_, _Insertion Sort_, _Selection Sort_).
However, due to its penalty in time complexity, improved algorithms like below are more likely to be in interviews.

- _Merge Sort_

                    i += 1
                else:

                k += 1

            # Drain rest of 'lo'
            while i < len(lo):
                nums[k] = lo[i]
                i += 1

        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return

        mid = len(nums) // 2
        left = nums[:mid]
        right = nums[mid:]

        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)
        merge(left, right)
    ```

    The more generic version of merge step will be _K Way Merge_ where it merges K Lists.

- Almost all Binary Search questions involve using either

    - Lists that is given either sorted or unsorted.

        - Not sorted: Need to use the built-in sort function and then think about what to apply with the sorted List.

# Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree

So far, we've looked into Sort / Binary Search on non-changing data sets since elements need to be only sorted once for Binary Search(es).
However, when elements are dynamically added / deleted, sorting the entire List every time is not efficient.
To address this issue, we use a special data structure called Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree.
Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree is a unique data structure not only because it keeps the ordering of elements, but it also self balances when you add / delete elements.
This is an important feature since without it, the tree will eventually get imbalanced and the search can take up to O(N) in worst case (same as linear scan).
Below is the time complexity of core operations on _Red Black Tree_ (a variant of Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree).

  - [Insert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaLIHuR1t8Q) O(logN)

  - [Delete](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTvfzU_uNKE) O(logN)

  - Access O(logN)

Python does not have a built-in Red-Black tree.
However, there is a widely used 3rd-party library called [sortedcontainers](https://grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/) and is generally allowed in interviews.
